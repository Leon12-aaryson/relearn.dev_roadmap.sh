## Javascript
Following from the basics I'm learning JS as a language for it's ability to do both front end and back-end

To do this we require the following resources to start:
- Node:
    - to use JavaScript you need to install node which allows you access to the NVM for node version management
    - You'll also get access to npm which is a package manager given that Javascript has many packages acting as dependencies for various tasks.

    To use npm for installation you have to do:
    ```
    npm install package-name
    ```

After setting up your work environment to work with JavaScript, there are various ways of testing if your JS environment is set up.
Most of this are already documented in the Node website. 
So for any references: [node.js](https://nodejs.org)

As a new user, want to see something exciting, head to your browser development environment and do the first code every developer does,
this is to print hello world!
In javascript that can be done by running ```console.log("Hello World!") ``` on your console or terminal in which machine you just installed NodeJS
