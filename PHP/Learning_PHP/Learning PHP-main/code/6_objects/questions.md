## Exercises
1. Create a class called Ingredient. Each instance of this class represents a single
ingredient. The instance should keep track of an ingredient’s name and its cost.
2. Add a method to your IngredientCost class that changes the cost of an ingredi!
ent.
3. Make a subclass of the Entree class used in this chapter that accepts Ingredient
objects instead of string ingredient names to specify the ingredients. Give your
Entree subclass a method that returns the total cost of the entrée.
4. Put your Ingredient class into its own namespace and modify your other code
that uses IngredientCost to work properly.
