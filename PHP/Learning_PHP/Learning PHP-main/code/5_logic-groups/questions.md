### Exercises
1. Write a function to return an HTML <img /> tag. The function should accept a
mandatory argument of the image URL and optional arguments for alt text,
height, and width.

2. Modify the function in the previous exercise so that only the filename is passed
to the function in the URL argument. Inside the function, prepend a global vari!
able to the filename to make the full URL. For example, if you pass photo.png to
the function, and the global variable contains /images/, then the src attribute of
the returned <img> tag would be /images/photo.png. A function like this is an
easy way to keep your image tags correct, even if the images move to a new path
or server. Just change the global variableâ€”for example, from /images/ to
http://images.example.com/.

3. Put your function from the previous exercise in one file. Then make another file
that loads the first file and uses it to print out some <img /> tags.

4. What does the following code print out?
```
<?php
    function restaurant_check($meal, $tax, $tip) {
        $tax_amount = $meal * ($tax / 100);
        $tip_amount = $meal * ($tip / 100);
        return $meal + $tax_amount + $tip_amount;
    }
    $cash_on_hand = 31;
    $meal = 25;
    $tax = 10;
    $tip = 10;

    while(($cost = restaurant_check($meal,$tax,$tip)) < $cash_on_hand) {
        $tip++;
        print "I can afford a tip of $tip% ($cost)\n";
    }
?>
```

5. Web colors such as #ffffff and #cc3399 are made by concatenating the hexa!
decimal color values for red, green, and blue. Write a function that accepts deci!
mal red, green, and blue arguments and returns a string containing the
appropriate color for use in a web page. For example, if the arguments are 255, 0,
and 255, then the returned string should be #ff00ff. You may find it helpful to
use the built-in function dechex(), which is documented at http://www.php.net/dechex.
